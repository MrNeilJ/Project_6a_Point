/* Write a class called Point that contains two doubles that represent its x- and y-coordinates.
 * It should have get and set methods for both fields.  It should have a constructor that takes
 * two double parameters and passes those values to the set methods to initialize its fields.
 * It should have a default constructor that initializes both coordinates to 0 (also using the
 * set methods).  It should also contain a method called distanceTo that takes as a parameter a
 * constant reference to another Point and returns the distance from the Point that was passed as
 * a parameter to the Point that we called the method of. You will need to use sqrt(). For example
 * at the end of the following, dist should be equal to 5.0:
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *  Point p1(-1.5, 0.0);
 *  Point p2(1.5, 4.0);
 *  double dist = p1.distanceTo(p2);
